<h3>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>
<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>
<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>
<h3>Designer Templates</h3>
<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>
<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>
<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
<h4>Know Something about Regular Expression</h4>
<p>Regular expressions use the backslash character <em>('\')</em> to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python's usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a <code>literal backslash</code>, one might have to write <strong>'\\\\'</strong> as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\ inside a regular Python string literal.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is important to note that most regular expression operations are available as module-level functions and RegexObject methods. The functions are shortcuts that don't require you to compile a regex object first, but miss some fine-tuning parameters.</p>

<p>Mastering Regular Expressions</p>
<p>Book on regular expressions by Jeffrey Friedl, published by O'Reilly. The second edition of the book no longer covers Python at all, but the first edition covered writing good regular expression patterns in great detail.</p></blockquote>
<p>The solution is to use Python's raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r'. So r"\n" is a two-character string containing '\' and 'n', while "\n" is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation.</p>
<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>
<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting &lt;a&gt; element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.</p>
